# Self Assessment

# My Written Analysis:

My main two roles have been to lead the group, and to work on the machine learning algorithm. The reason why I picked the leader of the group, was to stay organized, and on top of things. I made sure the README on the main branch was always up to date, this tasks we had to do, what we were working on, and what we completed. I also made sure to add the questions, and descriptions to match the Rubrics. Taking on this leadership role was a big responsibility, and I had to stay on top of it. 

Now let's talk about the second role, the machine learning. At first, I thought I knew a decent amount about machine learning. But I did not, I had so much to learn. Trying to code something I didn't understand was a huge undertaking. I went from trying to make a logistical regression model, to then switching over to a linear regression model. The reason for the change was from the help of my teammates. After talking with them, and thinking about it, a linear model made more sense to use for our project. 

The Biggest Personal Challenge for me, was optimizing the model so it was accurate. I could not figure out what I had to do to create an accurate model. The first run through of our model, we got an accuracy of 0.000E6. Which was pretty bad, so there was a lot of improving. Thankfully with enough research, and help from my teammates, we were able to get a pretty high accuracy after all. 

# My Written Summary:

How I contributed to each role I did not play in: For the data cleaning, and SQL work, I was one of them who used google to help find code to accomplish what we wanted. SQL was a big weakness for me, but thankfully my teammates were amazing at it. With google on my side, I was able to have some input on how to create different csv files, using SQL. Creating graphs using Excel was also a weak area. I haven't used excel in that way since the first week of school. So it was interesting to re-learn how to use it. Personally, I could only give verbal ideas of what to do. 

# The Project Summary:

We communicated using a group chat on our phones. We were able to get each others phone numbers the week of the final project. We would arrange zoom meetings at night to discuss the needs, and the do's for the project. As well as working on things together. Having that clear communication was key in this whole thing. Some of the challenges we had was knowing what we wanted to do with the datasets. We would improve that by doing, and having a mindset of a data analysis. 

Our team strengths was teamwork. Everyone had a role, and we did everything together. On zoom, everyone had their cameras on, and we could see eachother. It made it enjoyable to have these meetings. Our tip to help:Contribute to your team.

Our Topic was Household Income vs expenditures, and we used the LSTM model for predictions. The results from this analysis was, in the year 2023, incomes and expenditures will have decreased.
