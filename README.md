# What to do
# Second Week:
* Finish getting all the commits per team member
* Finish the Machine Learning DataSet

# Ask yourself the following questions: 
 * Which ideas are essential to the project? 
 * Which would be nice to have? 
 * Which would involve too much work to complete on time?

# To sum up, your team needs to complete the following before meeting with your instructor:
* Create the Machine Learning Algorithm

# Content
* The Topic:
Household incomes and expenditures. The reason why we picked this topic was due to the fact that todays economy is crazy, and we want to see if we can predict how bad (or good) the economy will get in the next year.

* The Source: 
Data was found on a government website, under the topic "Economy". Link:https://www.stats.govt.nz/large-datasets/csv-files-for-download/#:~:text=CSV%20files%20are%20text%20files%20with%20information%20separated,Microsoft%20Excel%2C%20the%20R%20statistical%20environment%2C%20or%20Python.
This data includes household income, and expenditures such as rent, gas, bills etc. 


* Questions we hope to answer with Data:
What will the economy look like in one year?
What will the economy look like in one year? 
Will the income and the expenditures both increase?
Will the data reflect what the economy will look like?


# Our Communication Protocols:
We found it easiest to set a timely schedule every night on zoom. Using Imessage to also keep in contact. We were all able to get together every night and work on the project together. We did not have roles for each team member, we worked on each section together until it was completed, before moving on to the next.
